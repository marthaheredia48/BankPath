## My Contributions

As part of Team Cook, I contributed to:

### Level 1 Front-End Prototype
- Developed the complete user registration flow using SwiftUI to securely capture MSME data  
- Created an interactive heatmap prototype in Swift to help entrepreneurs explore optimal market locations ‚Äî built as a functional prototype using simulated data  

### Onboarding Workflow Architecture & Design for Levels 3‚Äì5:
- **Level 3:** Designed the BBVA account request UI with fields for business name, RFC, business type, and conditional document upload steps  
- **Level 4:** Integrated CoreLocation to capture and verify the exact business address, alongside designing interfaces for uploading photos and videos  
- **Level 5:** Simulated the digital onboarding flow including automatic scoring, OTP email verification, and digital contract signing
